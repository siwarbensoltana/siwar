<STRONG>As the death toll mounted on Saturday, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for northern Gaza
 issuing instructions for residents near Jabalia to evacuate to the south of the enclave
 The Israel military launched a deadly offensive in the Jabalia area a week ago which it claims is
 aimed at stopping Palestinian group Hamas from regrouping. The attacks have trapped thousands of Palestinian civilians, international charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, said.

Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Saturday that Israeli fighter jets bombed a multistorey 
apartment block in Jabalia on Friday night, hitting four inhabited homes and killing 22 people.

At least 30 people were injured, and 14 people remain missing and are believed to be buried under the rubble, according to Wafa
